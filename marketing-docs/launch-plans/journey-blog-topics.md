## Learning Problems (Pain Point Topics)

### Topic 1: "Nobody Uses the Glossary (And Why That's a Design Problem)"

**Pain Point**: Glossaries exist, but nobody uses them

**Outline**:

- The problem: 100+ terms defined, but teams still ask "What does X mean?"
- Why glossaries fail: Effort, lack of context, not embedded in workflow
- The solution: Glossaries that surface automatically in context (AI-powered)
- How we're building it: Hover over term → see definition (no searching)

**Target Persona**: Product Managers, Team Members

**CTA**: Star the repo, join Discord to discuss

---

### Topic 2: "We Create 10x More Than We Consume (And It's Killing Productivity)"

**Pain Point**: We create more than we consume

**Outline**:

- The data: 100 docs written, 5 actually read
- Why it happens: No time, no search, no habit
- The cost: Wasted effort, repeated mistakes, siloed knowledge
- The solution: AI summaries (3 sentences instead of 10 pages)
- How we're building it: AI coach that distills knowledge automatically

**Target Persona**: Product Managers, Leadership

**CTA**: Share your biggest knowledge overload challenge

---

### Topic 3: "Learning Takes Too Much Effort (Here's How to Make It Automatic)"

**Pain Point**: Learning takes too much effort

**Outline**:

- The problem: Onboarding takes weeks, training is manual, glossaries are forgotten
- Why it's hard: Effort, time, lack of context

- Examples: Glossary pop-ups, AI onboarding guides, decision rationale captured automatically
- How we're building it: Learning as a side effect of using the product

**Target Persona**: Product Managers, Team Members, Leadership

**CTA**: What's your biggest learning challenge?

---

### Topic 4: "Project Plans Are Inaccessible (And It's Costing You Alignment)"

**Pain Point**: Project plans are not easy to understand or access—sometimes don't even exist

**Outline**:

- The problem: Plans buried in Google Docs, outdated, unclear
- Why it happens: Manual updates, siloed tools, no single source of truth

- How we're building it: Roadmaps that update automatically, visible to everyone

**Target Persona**: Product Managers, Leadership

**CTA**: How do you share project plans today?

---

### Topic 5: "Nobody Knows the Glossary (Because It's Not Where They Work)"

**Pain Point**: Nobody knows the glossary

**Outline**:

- The problem: Glossary lives in Notion, but work happens in Jira/Slack
- Why it fails: Context switching, effort, not embedded
- The solution: Glossary embedded in workflows (AI surfaces terms in context)
- Example: Writing a doc → AI suggests relevant terms → hover for definition
- How we're building it: Contextual AI coaching

**Target Persona**: Product Managers, Team Members

**CTA**: Where does your glossary live?

---
