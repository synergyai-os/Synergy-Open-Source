## 📖 Vision Migration

This represents a **major pivot** from personal knowledge management to organizational product development platform. The current codebase serves as a foundation—proof that one person with AI can build powerful tools on a $60/month budget.

See **[VISION-MIGRATION.md](./VISION-MIGRATION.md)** for details on what changed and why.

## 🧭 Philosophy

**Built by one developer, AI, and a keyboard**  
No VC funding. No deadlines. Just rapid iterations, outcome-driven development, and a commitment to open source. When partners like Agency Partner validate the vision, we invest more.

**Community-first, privacy-first**  
Open source. Offline-capable. Self-hostable. Your data, your AI, your privacy.

**Outcomes over outputs**  
We don't ship features. We achieve outcomes. Every document here is focused on _what success looks like_, not _when we'll ship_.

---

## 🤝 Contributing

These documents are living artifacts. As we learn, we update them. If you're contributing:

- Focus on **outcomes**, not timelines
- Keep it **concise but detailed** enough to dive deeper
- Use **high-level concepts**—we'll figure out implementation together
- Reference existing patterns in `/dev-docs/patterns/`
