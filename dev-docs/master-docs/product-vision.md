## The Problem We're Solving

### For Product Teams

Product teams today struggle with:

1. **Fragmented Tools**
   - Notion for docs, Jira for tasks, Miro for workshops, Slack for comms, Loom for videos
   - Context switching kills productivity
   - Knowledge scattered across 10+ tools
   - Expensive ($50-200/user/month combined)

2. **Learning Takes Too Much Effort**
   - No time to onboard properly
   - Glossaries exist but nobody uses them
   - Project plans buried in documents
   - Tribal knowledge lives in people's heads

3. **Alignment is Hard**
   - Unclear strategies and goals
   - Roadmaps outdated the day they're published
   - Meetings don't result in action
   - Status updates are manual, time-consuming

4. **We Create More Than We Consume**
   - 100 documents written, 5 read
   - Research done but never referenced
   - Decisions made but rationale forgotten
   - Learning happens but isn't captured

5. **Existing Solutions Don't Fit**
   - **Holaspirit**: Expensive, rigid, closed-source
   - **Notion**: General-purpose, not product-focused
   - **Jira**: Engineering-centric, not discovery-friendly
   - **Custom builds**: Expensive, time-consuming, hard to maintain

### For Organizations (Agency Partner, Client)

Software companies (even those who don't think they are) need:

- A system to **organize teams** and their knowledge
- **Product discovery** and **delivery** tools in one place
- **Outcome-driven frameworks** (OKRs, continuous discovery)
- **Privacy and control** over their data
- **Customization** without rebuilding everything

## Our Solution: The Product OS

### What It Is

An **open-source, modular platform** that integrates:

- **Product discovery** (user research, opportunity trees, continuous discovery)
- **Product delivery** (roadmaps, goal tracking, sprint planning)
- **Team collaboration** (meetings, alignment, communication)
- **Knowledge management** (glossaries, docs, learning)
- **AI coaching** (trained on company data, not generic ChatGPT)
- **Automated workflows** (workshops, reports, status updates)

### What Makes It Different

#### 1. Learning Built In

- **Glossaries** surface automatically in context
- **AI summaries** of long documents
- **Onboarding** embedded in workflows
- **Learning from decisions** captured and accessible

#### 2. AI Coaching with Your Data

- **Open source**: Audit the code, trust the system

#### 4. Community-Driven

- **Builder marketplace**: Custom apps, workflows, integrations
- **Open standards**: Extend, customize, integrate
- **Passionate community**: Product people building better tools together
- **No vendor lock-in**: Export your data anytime
- **Network effects**: More users → More contributors → Better product → More users (compounding growth)

#### 5. Outcome-Driven Frameworks

- **OKRs** (Objectives & Key Results)
- **Continuous discovery** (Teresa Torres)
- **Jobs-to-be-Done** (JTBD)
- **Opportunity solution trees**
- **Impact mapping**
- **North Star metrics**

   - Rapid iterations, no bureaucracy
   - Lean, focused, outcome-driven

2. **Agency Partner needs this now**
   - Real customer pain

   - Large potential (Client is just one client)

3. **Open source wins**
   - Trust: Teams can audit the code
   - Customization: Every org has unique needs

## What We're NOT Building

### Not a CRM

- We're not Salesforce or HubSpot
- We don't manage customer relationships (unless a builder creates that app)

### Not a Project Management Tool

- We're not Asana or Monday.com
- We're product-focused (discovery + delivery), not task-focused

### Not a Generic Collaboration Tool

- We're not Slack or Microsoft Teams
- We integrate with them, but focus on product workflows

### Not a Solo Tool

- We evolved from personal knowledge management, but now focus on teams
- Individual features exist, but serve team outcomes

## How to Talk About It

### Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)

"We're building the open-source Product OS—a platform that embeds learning, AI coaching, and product discovery at the core. Think Holaspirit meets Notion meets ChatGPT, but privacy-first, community-driven, and built for product teams."

### For Agency Partner (1 minute)

"You need to replace Holaspirit with something that's customizable, affordable, and open. We built a platform that handles team alignment, knowledge sharing, and product management—with AI coaching trained on your data, not generic advice. You can self-host it, customize workflows, and it costs a fraction of existing tools. Plus, it's open source, so you're never locked in."

### For Client (1 minute)

"Running multiple product teams is hard—unclear roadmaps, misaligned goals, knowledge silos. We built a platform that brings everything together: product discovery, roadmap tracking, automated status reports, and built-in glossaries. Your teams stay aligned, meetings are more effective, and onboarding new members is painless. It's like having an AI coach that knows your workspace."

### For the Community (1 minute)

"Product teams deserve better tools. We're building an open-source Product OS that embeds learning, AI coaching, and product frameworks at the core.

## Risks & Mitigations

### Risk: "Too ambitious"

- **Mitigation**: Start small (Agency Partner validation), expand incrementally
- **Proof**: Already built working foundation with $60/month

### Risk: "Open source = no revenue"

- **Mitigation**: Managed service, enterprise support, marketplace revenue share
- **Proof**: PostHog, Supabase, Cal.com prove the model

### Risk: "Community won't contribute"

- **Mitigation**: Clear contribution guidelines, starter issues, great DX
- **Proof**: Solving real pain = motivated contributors

### Risk: "AI hype will fade"

- **Mitigation**: AI is an enhancement, not the core value prop
- **Proof**: Product frameworks are timeless, AI makes them easier

### Risk: "Incumbents will copy us"

- **Mitigation**: Open source community = moat; incumbents can't pivot fast
- **Proof**: Speed and community beat features

---

## Next Steps

1. **Validate with Agency Partner**: Get first paying customer
2. **Build Multi-Tenancy**: Enable teams and workspaces
3. **Launch Community**: GitHub, Discord, journey blog
4. **Ship Core Features**: Product discovery & delivery tools
5. **Open Marketplace**: Enable builders to extend the platform

---

**The opportunity**: Build the platform product teams wish existed—open, private, AI-powered, community-driven.
