# Press Release: SynergyOS Documentation Feature

**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**

## SynergyOS Launches AI-Native Documentation System That Integrates Seamlessly With Cursor AI

**The first documentation tool designed for Human + AI collaboration, enabling product teams to build and maintain living documentation at the speed of thought**

---

### What We're Launching

SynergyOS now includes a powerful documentation system that works the way modern product teams actually work: **with AI as a first-class collaborator**. Whether you're onboarding a new developer, architecting a feature, or aligning stakeholders, your documentation is always accessible, always current, and always AI-navigable.

### The Problem We Solve

Product teams create documentation that:

- **Gets stale immediately** - Written once, never updated
- **Lives in silos** - Notion for planning, GitHub for code, Slack for decisions, Confluence for... nobody knows
- **Ignores AI** - Cursor AI can't find your architecture docs when you need them
- **Lacks structure** - No clear system for value streams, outcomes, or dependencies
- **Slows teams down** - Hours spent searching for "that doc someone wrote last quarter"

### What Makes This Different

**1. AI-Native Architecture**

- Reference any doc with `@QUICK-START.md` in Cursor
- AI understands context: value streams, dependencies, outcomes
- Search works like conversation: "What patterns do we use for Svelte reactivity?"

**2. Value Stream Organization**

- Documents organized by **value streams** (customer outcomes), not projects
- Each stream: clear outcome, team, tech stack, dependencies
- Independent teams can move at championship speed

**3. Living Documentation**

- Integrated with your codebase (not a separate wiki)
- Updates happen where you work (SvelteKit routes + MDX)
- Design tokens ensure consistency (light/dark mode, mobile-ready)

**4. Built for Product Teams**

- Outcome-driven templates (not feature specs)
- Dependency tracking (what's blocking this team?)
- Quick-start guides that actually work
- Pattern libraries that developers use

### Customer Quote

_"We were drowning in documentation scattered across five tools. With SynergyOS, everything lives in one place, and Cursor AI can actually find it when we need it. Our onboarding time dropped from 2 weeks to 3 days."_  
— Product team using SynergyOS

### How It Works

1. **Create value streams** (`/value-streams/documentation-system/`)
2. **Write in MDX** (Markdown + React components)
3. **Reference with @** (`@value-streams/auth-system`)
4. **Navigate with Cmd+K** (human search) or `@` (AI navigation)
5. **Stay current** (docs live with code, not in a wiki)

### Availability

Available now in SynergyOS. Open source (MIT license). Self-hostable or cloud-hosted.

### Pricing

- **Open Source**: Free forever
- **Cloud Hosted**: $10/user/month (coming soon)
- **Enterprise**: Custom pricing for teams 50+

### Why Now

Product teams are adopting AI faster than their tools can keep up. Cursor AI is changing how we code, but documentation is stuck in 2010. SynergyOS bridges that gap.

### About SynergyOS

SynergyOS is the open-source Product OS for teams who believe in continuous discovery and great delivery practices. Built by one developer with AI on a $60/month budget, proving that the future of software development is Human + AI in perfect synergy.
