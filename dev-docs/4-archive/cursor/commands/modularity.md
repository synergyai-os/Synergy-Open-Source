Consider Modularity:

- Independent development: teams can work on modules without conflicts
- Independent deployment: deploy modules separately
- Independent enablement: turn modules on/off per org/tenant
- Clear contracts: modules communicate via defined APIs
- Loose coupling: modules don't directly depend on each other's internals
