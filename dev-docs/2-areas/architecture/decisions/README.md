# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

**Architecture decisions and their rationale**

## Current ADRs

- [Auth Decision: Convex vs WorkOS](../auth/auth-decision-convex-vs-workos.md) - Why we chose WorkOS over Convex Auth
- [Multi-Session Architecture](../auth/multi-session-architecture.md) - Session handling approach

## ADR Process

1. **Document Problem**: What problem are we solving?
2. **Evaluate Alternatives**: What options did we consider?
3. **Choose Solution**: What did we decide and why?
4. **Document Decision**: Create ADR with context and rationale
