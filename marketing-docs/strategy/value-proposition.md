## For Saprolab (IT Supplier Building Products)

### The Problem
- **Holaspirit is expensive**: $15-30/user/month adds up fast
- **Rigid and closed**: Can't customize workflows or extend functionality
- **Generic**: Not built for product teams specifically
- **Vendor lock-in**: Your data, their rules
- **Scaling costs**: More users = exponentially more expensive

### Our Solution
**An affordable, customizable, open-source alternative**

- ✅ **$X/month flat rate** (vs. $15-30/user/month)
- ✅ **Self-hosted option** (full control over data)
- ✅ **Product-focused** (discovery, delivery, OKRs built in)
- ✅ **Customizable** (plugin architecture, open source)
- ✅ **No vendor lock-in** (export data anytime, audit code)

### The Outcome
**Save 70%+ on costs while gaining more control, flexibility, and product-specific features.**

## For ZDHC (Non-Profit Running Product Teams)

### The Problem
- **Too many products, unclear priorities**: Roadmap deadlines pile up, strategy unclear
- **Knowledge silos**: Glossaries exist but nobody uses them; tribal knowledge in people's heads
- **Misaligned teams**: Everyone building, but toward different goals
- **Ineffective meetings**: Stand-ups, planning, retros feel like status theater
- **Onboarding takes forever**: New team members lost for weeks
- **Documents never read**: 100 docs created, 5 actually referenced

### Our Solution
**A unified platform that aligns teams, captures knowledge, and makes meetings effective**

- ✅ **Outcome-driven roadmaps**: Focus on problems solved, not features shipped
- ✅ **Glossaries in context**: Terms surface automatically when needed
- ✅ **AI coaching**: Ask questions, get answers from your company data
- ✅ **Built-in meetings**: Stand-ups, retros, planning with automated notes
- ✅ **Real-time alignment**: Everyone sees goals, progress, rationale
- ✅ **Automated reports**: Status updates generated automatically

### The Outcome
**Aligned teams, effective meetings, faster onboarding, and decisions backed by data—not guesswork.**

## For Product Teams Everywhere

### The Problem
**Fragmented tools kill productivity**:
- Notion for docs
- Jira for tasks
- Miro for workshops
- Slack for communication
- Loom for videos
- Google Drive for files
- Confluence for wikis

**Result**:
- Context switching waste 2+ hours/day
- Knowledge scattered across 10+ tools
- $50-200/user/month combined costs
- Onboarding takes weeks (learn 10 tools)
- Search is impossible (which tool was that in?)

### Our Solution
**One platform for the entire product workflow**

- ✅ **Product discovery**: User research, opportunity trees, continuous discovery
- ✅ **Product delivery**: OKRs, roadmaps, sprint planning
- ✅ **Team collaboration**: Meetings, alignment, communication
- ✅ **Knowledge management**: Glossaries, docs, learning
- ✅ **AI coaching**: Context-aware, trained on your data

### The Outcome
**One tool to learn. One place to search. One source of truth. 80% cost savings. 10+ hours/week saved per team.**

## Unique Differentiators

### 1. Learning Built In
**Problem**: Onboarding takes weeks. Glossaries exist but aren't used. Knowledge lives in people's heads.

**Our Solution**:
- **Glossaries surface in context**: Hover over a term, see definition
- **AI summaries**: Long docs → 3-sentence summaries
- **Onboarding workflows**: Step-by-step guides embedded in the product
- **Learning from decisions**: Capture rationale, reference later

**Outcome**: New team members productive in days. Everyone speaks the same language.

---

### 2. AI Coaching with Your Data
**Problem**: Generic ChatGPT doesn't know your company, goals, or past decisions.

**Our Solution**:
- **Context-aware**: AI trained on your docs, decisions, glossaries
- **Proactive**: Suggests next steps during workshops, planning
- **Learning**: Builds on past decisions, avoids repeating mistakes
- **Personalized**: Knows your team's workflows, not generic advice

**Outcome**: AI becomes a force multiplier, not just a search engine.

---

### 3. Privacy-First Architecture
**Problem**: Most tools own your data. Security-conscious orgs can't use cloud SaaS.

**Our Solution**:
- **Offline-first**: Works without internet
- **Self-hosted**: Run on your infrastructure (AWS, Azure, on-prem)
- **Bring-your-own AI**: OpenAI, Claude, local LLMs, or your own
- **Encryption**: Data encrypted at rest and in transit
- **Open source**: Audit the code, trust the system

**Outcome**: Security teams approve. Compliance teams approve. You stay in control.

---

### 4. Community-Driven
**Problem**: Vendor-controlled tools force you to wait for features. Custom builds lack maintenance.

**Our Solution**:
- **100+ contributors**: Community fixes bugs, adds features
- **Builder marketplace**: Extend with custom apps
- **Open standards**: Integrate with anything
- **No vendor lock-in**: Export data anytime, fork the code if needed

**Outcome**: Features ship faster. Bugs fixed faster. No waiting on vendor roadmaps.

---

### 5. Outcome-Driven Frameworks
**Problem**: Most tools focus on outputs (features shipped), not outcomes (problems solved).

**Our Solution**:
- **OKRs built in**: Objectives & Key Results as first-class citizens
- **Opportunity solution trees**: Teresa Torres continuous discovery
- **Impact mapping**: Connect goals → user needs → solutions
- **North Star metrics**: Track what actually matters

**Outcome**: Teams align on outcomes. Decisions backed by data. Less waste.
