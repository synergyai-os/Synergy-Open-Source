validate if its resolved correctly (within ticket scope/criteria). If yes. update /linear ticket

- NEVER update our ticket after finding a problem and making edits in our code. This requires a new round of validation by me and you.
- NEVER create an MD document. Keep everything inside the relevant ticket. if no ticket exists, return your feedback as a chat comment.
