# Meetings Module - Nice-to-Have Features

This document describes features that are planned or considered for future implementation but are not part of the core essentials.

## Guest Access

### Overview

Guest access allows unregistered users to join meetings via secure invite links. This enables external participants (clients, contractors, partners) to participate in meetings without requiring full system accounts.

### Guest Functionality

- **Guests** - Unregistered users who can join via secure invite links
  - Guests are not logged in or registered users
  - Access granted via special secure invite link generated by registered users
  - Any registered user can generate invite link when meeting is scheduled or running
  - Guests can only access the specific meeting they're invited to
  - Links are secure and meeting-specific (cannot access other meetings)
  - Guests can participate like regular users but only in the meeting they're invited to

### Guest Access in Meeting Attendees

- **Meeting Attendees** - Polymorphic attendees (user/role/circle/guest)
  - Can invite specific users, roles (anyone filling a role), entire circles, or guests
  - Supports flexible meeting participation models including external participants

### Guest Visibility

- Guests appear in presence tracking as "guests" (unexpected joiners)
- Guests are distinguished from expected attendees (invited registered users)

### Implementation Notes

- Guest access requires secure link generation and validation
- Guest sessions are ephemeral and meeting-specific
- Guest permissions are limited to the specific meeting they're invited to
