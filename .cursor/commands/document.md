Now keep in mind we want to turn this into a blog post. So every now and then we update an craft the journey we go to. sometimes we want to copy paste entire chats for reference later. For each blog post that we generate, we start with a journey document which tracks the timeline of our progress, development, the why behind it and with that file, you will use that as your starting input for writing the actualy blog post...

First create the document. Then start with the first suggested step.

Create the necceseary documents as well to develop the high level details and key decisions or business rules and dependencies we discover in the right value stream team in dev-docs.

After that do the work. start with 1, then 2. I will validate along the way.
