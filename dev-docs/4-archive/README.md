## Archiving Guidelines

### When to Archive

Archive when:

- Project completed and no longer needs active tracking
- Feature deprecated and removed from codebase
- Documentation replaced by newer version
- Approach abandoned for better alternative

### How to Archive

1. Move file/folder to `4-archive/`
2. Prepend filename with completion date: `2024-11-08-old-feature.md`
3. Add banner to top of document:
   ```markdown
   > ⚠️ **ARCHIVED**: This document is no longer active. Archived on YYYY-MM-DD.
   > **Reason**: [Completed | Deprecated | Superseded]
   > **See instead**: [link to replacement if applicable]
   ```
4. Update any references in active docs to point to new location/replacement

### Why Keep Archives?

- 📜 Historical context for decisions
- 📜 Learning from past approaches
- 📜 Reference for similar future projects
- 📜 Institutional knowledge preservation
