**Minor Gaps**:
- ⚠️ roadmap-operations.md still has placeholder dates "[Date]" (template, not critical)

**To Improve**:
- Update roadmap-operations.md template dates to 2025-11-19 (low priority - it's a template)
- Consider adding executive one-pager summary (nice-to-have)

**Why Not 10/10**: Template placeholders in roadmap-operations.md (minor, non-blocking)

---
