# High-Level Opportunities: Ideas to Explore

> **Purpose**: Capture all potential opportunities and directions we could pursue—organized by theme, with enough detail to dive deeper later, but concise enough to evaluate quickly.

---

## How to Use This Document

### Not a Roadmap
- These are **opportunities**, not commitments
- Evaluate each based on outcomes, validation, and strategic fit
- Some will become features, some will stay ideas

### Evaluation Criteria
For each opportunity, ask:
1. **Does it achieve an outcome?** (not just a feature)
2. **Does it validate with Saprolab/ZDHC?** (real customer need)
3. **Does it enable community?** (platform, not one-off)
4. **Does it compound?** (value increases over time)
5. **Can we validate quickly?** (1-2 weeks)

## Opportunity 9: AI Coach with Company Data

### What
Build an AI coach that's trained on company data (docs, decisions, glossaries)—context-aware, not generic.

### Why
- **Context**: Knows your company, not generic advice
- **Proactive**: Suggests next steps, doesn't wait for questions
- **Learning**: Captures decisions, builds on past
- **Onboarding**: New members get answers instantly

### How (High-Level)
- Ingest company data: Docs, decisions, glossaries, roadmaps
- RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation): Retrieve relevant docs, feed to AI
- Contextual queries: "Why did we decide X?" → AI references past decisions
- Proactive suggestions: During planning, AI suggests relevant research

**Use Cases**:
- Onboarding: "What does [term] mean?" → AI explains
- Planning: "What research supports this?" → AI surfaces relevant docs
- Retrospectives: "What did we learn from [project]?" → AI summarizes

### Success Signals
- ✅ Teams ask AI instead of searching docs (10+ queries/week)
- ✅ Onboarding time reduced by 50%+
- ✅ Decisions referenced 3x more often (AI surfaces them)

### Dependencies
- Company data ingestion (structured, searchable)

- Distribute: Email, Slack, platform dashboard
- Customizable: Frequency (daily, weekly), format, audience

**Example Report**:
```
📊 Weekly Status Report (Week of Nov 7)

🎯 OKRs Progress:

### Why
- **Trust**: Security-conscious orgs approve it
- **Control**: Users own their data
- **Compliance**: GDPR, SOC 2, HIPAA-ready
- **Differentiation**: Most tools force cloud SaaS

### How (High-Level)
- **Offline-first**: Works without internet (sync when connected)
- **Self-hosted**: Docker deployment, run on your infrastructure
- **Bring-your-own AI**: OpenAI, Claude, local LLMs, or your own
- **Encryption**: Data encrypted at rest and in transit
- **Open source**: Audit the code, trust the system

**Deployment Options**:
1. Cloud-hosted (managed by us)
2. Self-hosted (AWS, Azure, on-prem)
3. Hybrid (some data self-hosted, some cloud)

### Success Signals
- ✅ Security teams approve (no blockers)
- ✅ Compliance teams approve (GDPR, SOC 2)
- ✅ 50%+ customers choose self-hosted (vs. cloud)

### Dependencies

## Opportunity 14: On-Site or Your Own AI

### What
Support bring-your-own AI (OpenAI, Claude, local LLMs, or customer's own AI)—flexible, not locked in.

### Why
- **Privacy**: Some orgs can't send data to OpenAI
- **Cost**: Local LLMs = free (after hardware)
- **Control**: Use the AI you trust
- **Differentiation**: Most tools force their AI

### How (High-Level)
- **Abstraction layer**: AI provider agnostic (OpenAI, Claude, local)
- **Configuration**: Choose provider in settings
- **Local LLMs**: Ollama, LLaMA, or custom models
- **API keys**: Bring your own (BYOK)
