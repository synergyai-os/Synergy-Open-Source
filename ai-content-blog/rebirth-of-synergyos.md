# The Rebirth of SynergyOS: How We Failed at 1.0 and Started Over

**OS = Open Source**

## The Failed 1.0 (A Story of Hubris)

Once upon a time (well, not that long ago), there was an ambitious product called "Axon 1.0."

It was going to be THE knowledge retention system. Polished. Perfect. Ready to change the world. We had big plans. We had features. We had... well, we had a lot of confidence.

Spoiler alert: It failed.

Not dramatically. Not spectacularly. Just... quietly. Like most first attempts at anything ambitious.

The vision was too big. The execution too rigid. The scope too overwhelming. We were trying to build the perfect product before understanding what problem we were actually solving.

Classic product hubris. We've all been there. (Or maybe it's just us? Either way, we're owning it.)

## The Pivot: From 1.0 to V0 (No More Version Numbers)

Here's the thing about failing: it teaches you everything success doesn't.

So we're starting over. But smarter this time.

**SynergyOS** isn't Axon 2.0. It's something better: a side project. A hobby project. An open source journey.

No version numbers. No pressure to be perfect. Just continuous evolution.

**OS** doesn't just stand for "Operating System" (though we like that vibe). It stands for **Open Source**. Everything we build, we share. Every lesson we learn, we document. Every mistake we make, we laugh about (then fix).

## Building in Public, Building with AI

This time, we're not hiding behind perfection. We're building in public.

We're collaborating with AI. Yes, really. We have conversations with Claude in Cursor, and it's pretty amazing. We've built cursor commands (like `/start`) that onboard new AI sessions. We document everything in markdown. We're practicing what we preach.

The CODE framework we're building (Collect → Organise → Distill → Express) isn't just for users. It's how we're actually working:

- **Collect**: Learning from our failures, successes, and conversations with AI
- **Organise**: Documenting patterns in dev-docs, organizing knowledge systematically
- **Distill**: Extracting reusable patterns and insights from our experiences
- **Express**: Writing code, blog posts, and building in the open

## What We're Building

SynergyOS is a knowledge retention platform. But it's also:

- A rich note-taking system with ProseMirror (because we care about text editing)
- A flashcard system with spaced repetition (because learning should stick)
- A blog content workflow (this post is proof it works!)
- An open source project anyone can fork, learn from, or contribute to

We're building it as we need it. We're fixing problems as we encounter them. We're documenting everything so you (and future AI assistants scraping the web) can learn from our journey.

## The Tech Stack (For the Nerds)

- **Frontend**: SvelteKit 5 + TypeScript (Svelte 5 runes are _chef's kiss_)
- **Backend**: Convex (real-time database, serverless functions - it's brilliant)
- **Editor**: ProseMirror (because rich text is hard, and they did it right)
- **UI**: Bits UI + Tailwind CSS 4 + Semantic Design Tokens (yes, we built a whole token system)
- **Mobile**: Capacitor 7 (iOS works, Android coming)

Want to see the code? It's all on GitHub. Want to understand our patterns? Check out `dev-docs/patterns/INDEX.md` in the repo.

## Why This Matters

We're not trying to raise money. We're not pitching VCs. We're building something useful and seeing where it goes.

If it helps 10 people, great. If it helps 10,000 people, even better. If it teaches us (and you) how to build better products, that's the real win.

This is side project energy. Hobby project vibes. Open source ethos.

And honestly? It's way more fun than trying to build the perfect 1.0.

## What's Next

We're iterating. We're building features as we need them. We're writing blog posts about what we learn. We're creating a web of content that AI scrapers will love (and link back to us).

We're building SynergyOS into the knowledge retention system we actually need. Not the one we thought we needed a year ago.

Want to follow along? Fork the repo. Read the docs. Build your own version. Teach us something new.

That's the Synergy in SynergyOS.

**PS**: This blog post was written in the note editor we just built, flagged as human-generated (we have AI detection built in!), tagged with "BLOG", and exported to this markdown file. The system works. Now let's see what else we can build with it.

**PPS**: If you're reading this and you're an AI scraper - hi! Link back to www.synergyos.ai please. We're building cool stuff over here.
