# Working with Linear - Critical Rules

**Purpose**: Essential rules that MUST be followed when creating Linear tickets.

---

# 🚨🚨🚨 CRITICAL: REFUSE to Work Without Linear Ticket ID 🚨🚨🚨

## ⛔ **FIRST CHECK - BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE**

**⚠️ HARD BLOCKER: You can ONLY work when a Linear ticket ID is present in the conversation context.**

**When `/start` is invoked or user asks you to work:**

### IMMEDIATE CHECK (Before reading docs, calling tools, or doing ANY work):

1. **Scan conversation for Linear ticket ID**:
   - Pattern: "SYOS-123", "SYOS-XXX" (any number)
   - Keywords: "ticket SYOS-", "Linear ticket", "issue SYOS-"
   - Check user's message, conversation history

2. **IF NO TICKET ID FOUND → STOP IMMEDIATELY:**

   **DO NOT:**
   - ❌ Read any documentation files
   - ❌ Call any tools (read_file, codebase_search, etc.)
   - ❌ Investigate the codebase
   - ❌ Proceed with onboarding
   - ❌ Do ANY work

   **RESPOND WITH:**
   ```
   ❌ I cannot proceed without a Linear ticket ID.
   
   Please provide:
   - Linear ticket ID (e.g., SYOS-123)
   - OR say "create new ticket" and I'll help you create one
   
   Once I have a ticket ID, I'll proceed with the work.
   ```

3. **IF TICKET ID FOUND → Continue with work**

## 📋 Creating Projects/Tickets

**See**: `/start` command - Complete ticket creation workflow with constants, examples, and format

**Quick Reference:**
- Use `/start` command when user says "create new ticket"
- All Linear constants (team ID, user ID, labels, estimates) are in `/start` command
- Ticket writing format: `dev-docs/2-areas/development/ticket-writing-format.md`

**🚫 REFUSAL RULE**: 
- **NO Linear project/ticket** → **REFUSE to work**
- **NO project ID** → **STOP and ask**
- **NO ticket ID** → **STOP and ask**

---

## 🚨 CRITICAL: ALWAYS Assign User as Ticket Owner

**Every ticket MUST be assigned to Randy:**

```typescript
await mcp_Linear_create_issue({
  team: 'SYOS',
  projectId: projectId, // ✅ Required (get/create first)
  assigneeId: 'c7c555a2-895a-48b6-ae24-d4147d44b1d5', // ✅ ALWAYS assign to Randy
  estimate: 2, // ✅ Required (numeric: 0-5)
  labels: [
    'ba9cfc2b-a993-4265-80dc-07fd1c831029', // feature (type - required)
    '7299ef53-982d-429d-b513-ccf190b28c16'  // backend (scope - required)
  ]
});
```

**Hardcoded IDs:**
- **Team**: `SYOS` (`08d684b7-986f-4781-8bc5-e4d9aead6935`)
- **User (Randy)**: `c7c555a2-895a-48b6-ae24-d4147d44b1d5`

---

## 📋 Required Ticket Fields

**Every ticket MUST have:**
- `team: 'SYOS'`
- `projectId` (not name - get/create project first)
- `assigneeId: 'c7c555a2-895a-48b6-ae24-d4147d44b1d5'` (Randy)
- `estimate: 0-5` (0=none, 1=xs, 2=s, 3=m, 4=l, 5=xl)
- `labels` (Type: feature/bug/tech-debt/risk + Scope: backend/frontend/ui/etc.)
