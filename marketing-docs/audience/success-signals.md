# Success Signals: How We Know We're Winning

> **Philosophy**: We track leading indicators (behavior), lagging indicators (outcomes), and impact signals (long-term value). Numbers tell part of the story—qualitative feedback completes it.

## How We Use Signals to Decide

### Scenario 1: Feature Request from Saprolab

**Signal Check**:

- Does it align with their success signals? (saves time, improves alignment)
- Will it help achieve outcomes? (not just a nice-to-have)
- Can we validate in 1-2 weeks?

**Decision**: If yes to all → prioritize. If no → defer or decline.

---

### Scenario 2: Low Feature Adoption

**Signal Check**:

- Which feature? (discovery, delivery, AI, glossary, meetings)
- Who's not using it? (Sarah, Alex, Jordan)
- Why not? (missing value, UX issue, awareness)

**Decision**: Investigate, simplify, or remove feature.

---

### Scenario 3: Community Growing Slowly

**Signal Check**:

- Are contributors blocked? (unclear contribution guidelines)
- Is awareness low? (no marketing, blog, social)
- Is DX poor? (hard to set up, poor docs)

**Decision**: Improve DX, increase awareness, engage contributors.
