## Journey Format

Each journey follows this structure:

```markdown
# Journey Name

> One-sentence summary

## User Goal

What the user wants to accomplish and why.

## Preconditions

What must be true before starting (permissions, data, setup).

## Steps

### Step 1: [Action]

**What**: User does X
**Where**: Page/component name
**Screenshot**: [Image]
**Notes**: Edge cases, tips

### Step 2: [Action]

...

## Success Criteria

How user knows they've succeeded.

## Edge Cases

- What if Y happens?
- Alternative path Z

## Why This Matters

**For Product Managers:**

- Understand end-to-end user experience
- Identify gaps and friction points
- Write better feature specs

**For Designers:**

- See user flows with UI context
- Identify UX improvements
- Validate design decisions

**For Engineers:**

- Understand feature purpose
- Implement correct behavior
- Test realistic scenarios

## Current State vs. Product Vision

### ❌ Current (Flashcard App)

- Collect highlights from Readwise
- Review inbox items
- Generate flashcards with AI
- Study with spaced repetition

### ✅ Future (Product OS)

- Set team OKRs
- Run discovery workshops
- Build roadmaps
- Track progress
- Coach with AI (trained on company data)

**See**: [Product Vision 2.0](../../../marketing-docs/strategy/product-vision-2.0.md) for full vision

## Data Sources

User journeys will be built from:

1. **Agency Partner needs** - First partner requirements (Client use cases)
2. **Competitive analysis** - Holaspirit, Notion, Jira workflows
3. **Product frameworks** - Teresa Torres (continuous discovery), John Cutler (OKRs)
4. **User interviews** - Real team pain points

**Next Steps**:

1. Create journey template
2. Document 4-5 core journeys (OKRs, roadmaps, workshops)
3. Add screenshots (mockups if feature not built yet)
4. Review with PM + design + engineering

**Estimated**: 1 day for 5 core journeys
