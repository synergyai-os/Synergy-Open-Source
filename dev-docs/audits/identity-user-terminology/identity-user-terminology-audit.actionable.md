## Scope

This report is intentionally narrow: it focuses on high-signal workspace UI terminology drift ("User" → "Person"), plus a short list of code identifier rename candidates.

## P1: Org-chart component file names containing "User"

Count: **0**

## P2: Workspace UI copy containing "User" (high-signal phrases only)

Count: **0**

## P3: Org-chart code identifiers containing "User" (rename candidates)

Count: **0** (capped at 200)
