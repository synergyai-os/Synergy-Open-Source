# Target Personas: Who We Serve

> **Core Insight**: We serve organizations building digital products—specifically IT suppliers, non-profits, and product teams who need to align, learn, and ship outcomes (not just features).

---

## Persona Overview

We organize personas by **role** in the buying and usage cycle:

1. **Buyer Persona**: Who decides to purchase/adopt
2. **User Personas**: Who actually uses the platform daily
3. **Champion Persona**: Who advocates internally and drives adoption
4. **System Persona**: Who implements, maintains, and customizes

---

## Primary Target: Agency Partner (Buyer + User)

### Organization Profile

- **Industry**: IT management supplier
- **Size**: Small-to-medium team (10-50 people)
- **Clients**: Large non-profits (Client, others)
- **Business Model**: Build technology and products for clients
- **Tech Maturity**: High (developers in-house, comfortable with open source)

### Pain Points

1. **Holaspirit is expensive**: $15-30/user/month adds up fast
2. **Rigid tool**: Can't customize workflows or extend functionality
3. **Generic features**: Not built for product teams specifically
4. **Vendor lock-in**: Data controlled by vendor, expensive to switch
5. **Scaling costs**: More users = exponentially more expensive
6. **Internal alignment**: Need better way to organize teams and knowledge

### Jobs to Be Done

**When** we're running internal operations and client projects,  
**we want to** align teams, capture knowledge, and ship outcomes,  
**so that** we deliver better products for clients without expensive, rigid tools.

### Success Criteria

- ✅ Replace Holaspirit with something affordable and customizable
- ✅ Save 70%+ on costs
- ✅ Customize workflows for our needs
- ✅ Use internally AND offer to clients (Client)
- ✅ Control our data (self-host option)

### Buying Process

1. **Awareness**: Frustrated with Holaspirit costs
2. **Consideration**: Evaluate alternatives (Notion, custom build, us)
3. **Evaluation**: Test with small team internally
4. **Decision**: Compare cost, customization, risk
5. **Purchase**: Start with self-hosted or managed service
6. **Expansion**: Roll out to Client if successful

### Objections & Concerns

- ❓ "Is this stable enough for production use?"
- ❓ "Can we customize it for Client's needs?"
- ❓ "What happens if the project is abandoned?"
- ❓ "Can we migrate our data from Holaspirit?"
- ❓ "Do we have resources to self-host?"

### How We Address

- ✅ Open source = audit the code, no black box
- ✅ Self-hosting = full control, no dependency on us
- ✅ Customization = plugin architecture, open standards
- ✅ Migration = export from Holaspirit, import to us (we help)
- ✅ Managed service = if self-hosting isn't feasible

## Secondary Target: Client (End User)

### Organization Profile

- **Industry**: Non-profit (environmental standards for fashion/textiles)
- **Size**: Large organization, multiple product teams
- **Tech Maturity**: Medium (IT supplier manages tech for them—Agency Partner)
- **Product Teams**: 1+ teams responsible for multiple products
- **Pain**: Too many products, unclear roadmaps, misaligned teams

### Pain Points

1. **Too many products, unclear priorities**: Roadmap deadlines pile up, strategy unclear
2. **Knowledge silos**: Glossaries exist but nobody uses them
3. **Misaligned teams**: Everyone building, but toward different goals
4. **Ineffective meetings**: Stand-ups, retros feel like status theater
5. **Onboarding is painful**: New members lost for weeks
6. **Documents never read**: 100 docs created, 5 actually referenced
7. **No single source of truth**: Information scattered across tools

### Jobs to Be Done

**When** running multiple product teams with overlapping goals,  
**we want to** align on outcomes, share knowledge, and make effective decisions,  
**so that** we build the right things and avoid wasting time on misalignment.

### Success Criteria

### Objections & Concerns

- ❓ "Will this replace Jira/Notion or add to them?"
- ❓ "Is our data secure?"
- ❓ "What if Agency Partner stops supporting this?"

### How We Address

- ✅ Unified platform = replaces 3-5 tools, less to learn
- ✅ Integrates with existing tools (Jira, Slack) if needed

## Anti-Personas (Who This Is NOT For)

### Solo Knowledge Workers

- **Why Not**: We focus on teams, not individuals
- **Alternative**: Use our original personal knowledge app (if we maintain it)

### Enterprise Buyers (Yet)

- **Why Not**: Early-stage, MVP mindset, not enterprise-polished
- **Future**: Will serve enterprises once validated with SMBs

### Non-Technical Organizations

- **Why Not**: Self-hosting requires some technical capability
- **Alternative**: Managed service option (when we offer it)

### Teams Not Building Products

- **Why Not**: We're product-focused (discovery + delivery)
- **Alternative**: Notion, Asana, or general-purpose tools
